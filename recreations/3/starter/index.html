            <p>Mandarin fish, also known as the mandarin dragonet or Synchiropus splendidus, is a small, brightly
                colored fish that is native to the Pacific Ocean, particularly around the coral reefs of the
                Indo-Pacific region. They are popular among aquarium hobbyists for their striking appearance and
                peaceful temperament.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Mandarin fish are known for their distinctive and vibrant coloration, which includes
                bright orange, blue, green, and purple hues arranged in a mesmerizing pattern of spots, stripes, and
                polka dots. They are small in size, typically reaching only about 3 inches in length, and have a unique
                way of swimming that involves hovering and flapping their fins in a mesmerizing motion. However, they
                can be challenging to care for in captivity, as they require a specialized diet of live foods and a
                well-maintained aquarium environment to thrive.</p>

            <p>Mandarin fish are known for their unique mating behavior, which involves an elaborate courtship ritual
                that culminates in the release of eggs and sperm into the water column. During the mating season, males
                perform a complex dance to attract females, flashing their bright colors and fins to signal their
                interest. Once a pair has formed, they engage in a spiral dance, rising up through the water column
                while releasing their gametes. The eggs are then carried away by the currents, where they hatch into
                larval fish that undergo a metamorphosis before settling on the ocean floor. This mating behavior is not
                only fascinating to observe, but also critical to the survival of the species.</p>

            <h2>Clownfish</h2>
            <figure>

            </figure>


            <p>Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, are a type of small, brightly colored fish that are native to the
                Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are famous for their association with sea anemones, which they use as
                protection from predators and to establish their territory. Clownfish are popular aquarium pets due to
                their striking appearance, ease of care, and fascinating behavior.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Clownfish are easily recognized by their bold colors, which can range from bright
                orange to red, pink, and yellow, with white stripes or patches. They have a unique relationship with sea
                anemones, which provide them with shelter and food. In return, the clownfish help to protect the
                anemones from predators by driving away intruders and keeping the surrounding area clean. Clownfish are
                also known for their ability to change sex, with dominant females transforming into males when needed.
            </p>

            <p>In the wild, clownfish feed on a variety of small organisms, such as plankton, algae, and small
                crustaceans. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of commercially prepared foods, as well as live or
                frozen foods. Clownfish are generally easy to care for in an aquarium, as they are hardy and can adapt
                well to a range of water conditions. However, they should be housed with suitable tank mates and
                provided with a suitable environment that includes a suitable anemone or other shelter.</p>

            <h2>Parrotfish</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-11.31.27-AM-e1623943971271.png"
                    alt="A parrotfish">
                <figcaption>A parrotfish</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Parrotfish are a group of tropical marine fish that are known for their vibrant colors, unique
                morphology, and important ecological role. They belong to the family Scaridae, which includes over 80
                species found in coral reefs and rocky areas around the world. Parrotfish are named for their beak-like
                teeth, which they use to scrape algae and other organisms from rocks and coral.</p>

            <p class="highlight">One of the most distinctive features of parrotfish is their ability to change color and
                pattern throughout their life cycle. Juvenile parrotfish are typically drab and camouflaged to avoid
                predators, while adults are brightly colored and often have intricate patterns and markings. Some
                species can even change their coloration to match their surroundings, making them difficult to spot by
                predators.</p>

            <p>Parrotfish play an important role in the coral reef ecosystem, as they help to control the growth of
                algae and promote the growth of new coral. They also help to break down coral and other hard substrates,
                which creates fine sand that is important for the formation of beaches and islands. However, some
                species of parrotfish are threatened by overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change, which
                highlights the need for conservation efforts to protect these important and unique creatures.</p>
