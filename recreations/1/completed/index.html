        <p>HTML is short for "Hypertext Markup Language." This page is made entirely with HTML; there is no CSS here! For this assignment, please copy the structure and content of this page as closely as possible.</p>

            <h2>This is a Section Title</h2>
            <p>Section elements should all have a heading tag in them. In this case, the section title above uses a heading 2 tag. It uses a heading 2 tag because the primary heading of the page uses a heading 1 tag, and headings should be ordered by their level of importance within the document. In case you were wondering, this is a paragraph tag, by the way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Another Section Title</h2>
            <p>Just like the section above, this section title uses a heading 2 tag again. That's because both of these sections have the same level of importance in the document hierarchy. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">Click here to learn more about HTML Headings.</a></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Yet Another Section Title</h2>
            <p>One thing to note about heading tags: we don't use them because of their style properties. It's nice that headings make text larger and bold, but the main reason we use them is because they communicate structure about the document. An h1 is more important than an h2, which is more important than an h3, and so on until h6, which is the smallest heading tag.</p>

            <h2>Try out some other HTML elements in this section</h2>
            <p>This section has a couple of different useful elements to try. Notice that the headings below are little smaller (they are heading 3 tags)</p>
